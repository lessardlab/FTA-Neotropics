<abstract>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> Functional traits are often used to infer the
ecological processes that determine the composition of species
assemblages. However, most trait-based approaches to infer community
assembly processes focus on a single trophic level. Owing to the
matching of traits facilitating interactions between resource and
consumer assemblages, the functional trait diversity of different
trophic levels is expected to covary in space. However, differential
response of consumers and producers to environmental gradients can cause
a decoupling of functional diversity between trophic levels, which we
coin functional trophic asymmetry. Here, we develop a metric to quantify
functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) and use it to infer the processes
underpinning multitrophic community assembly, and explore the role of
these processes in shaping the topology of ecological networks.</p>
<p><bold>Location:</bold> Neotropics.</p>
<p><bold>Time period:</bold> Present.</p>
<p><bold>Major taxa:</bold> Mammalian frugivores and palms.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We use digitally available data on the
functional traits, pairwise mutualistic interactions, and geographic
distributions of consumers (mammalian frugivores) and their producers
(palms) to quantify functional trophic asymmetry for species occurring
in the Neotropics. To cover major data gaps between species-level trait
and interaction data, we train machine learning models to generate
synthetic network data. We then use linear regression models to relate
functional asymmetry to variation in climate, and to assess the
influence of functional asymmetry on network specialization.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Our approach generated probabilistic networks
across 1,072 grid cells in the Neotropics, revealing networks with a
clearly defined modular structure and substantial differences in their
functional richness across trophic levels. Functional trophic asymmetry
increases from regions of the Neotropics with low precipitation
seasonality to regions with high precipitation seasonality. Along this
same climatic gradient, network specialization is positively related to
functional trophic asymmetry.</p>
<p><bold>Main conclusions:</bold> Our results further suggest that
mutualistic interactions between palms and mammals are mediated by
matching traits and taxonomic overlap as a key assembly process at the
regional scale. We conclude that increased warming and seasonal shifts
in precipitation caused by global climate change could
disproportionately impact specialist species while increasing functional
trophic asymmetry in ecological networks.</p>

  <p>Classical approaches to study community assembly rely on the
  concept of environmental filtering, sorting or selection, where
  density independent conditions constrain the functional richness of
  species assemblages

  relative frequency of different functional traits observed in a
  community. It is often used to estimate the strength of selection
  imposed by the environment

  <xref alt="Kraft et al. 2015" rid="ref-kraft2015community" ref-type="bibr">Kraft

  environmental selection whereas low functional richness can indicate
  strong selection

  environmental selection can cascade across trophic levels such that
  selection on consumer traits can shape the functional richness of
  their resources, modulated by their degree of reciprocal dependency or
  co-evolution

  (<xref alt="Marjakangas et al. 2022" rid="ref-marjakangas2022trait" ref-type="bibr">Marjakangas

  <p>Inferring the relative strength of environmental selection between
  trophic levels requires using high-dimensional approaches that are
  able to deal with sparse observations for a large number of species
  (<xref alt="Rohr et al. 2010" rid="ref-rohr2010modeling" ref-type="bibr">Rohr

  <xref alt="Strydom et al. 2022" rid="ref-strydom2022food" ref-type="bibr">Strydom
  et al. 2022</xref>). We introduce the concept of functional trophic
  asymmetry (FTA), which allows inferring the relative influence of
  environmental selection and trait matching on the composition of
  multitrophic assemblages
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Figure%201">(Figure
  1)</ext-link>. FTA is the difference in the richness of
  interaction-relevant traits between trophic levels in a multitrophic
  network. FTA can occur because traits mediating species interactions
  (i.e., interaction niches) across trophic levels can also mediate the
  responses of species to their abiotic environment (i.e. environmental
  niches)

  Golovina, and Buitink 2001</xref>). High FTA could indicate
  differences in the strength of environmental selection over the
  interaction niches of distinct trophic levels within a multitrophic
  species assemblage. Alternatively, low FTA could indicate that the
  strength of the environment selection shaping interaction niches is
  similar between trophic levels, e.g. equally weak or equally strong
  (<xref alt="Marjakangas et al. 2022" rid="ref-marjakangas2022trait" ref-type="bibr">Marjakangas
  et al. 2022</xref>). When interactions between producers and consumers
  are mutualistic, low FTA could also emerge under strong trait matching
  and therefore indicate the influence of trait-coevolution during
  multitrophic community assembly

  are involved in interactions across trophic levels, the filtering of
  traits along environmental gradients could constrain the number of
  unique interactions and therefore, network topology

  <xref alt="Albrecht et al. 2018" rid="ref-albrecht2018plant" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht
  et al. 2018</xref>). As an example, low multitrophic functional
  richness could influence emergent patterns in network structure such
  as the specialization of multispecies interactions by limiting the
  relative availability of interaction partners across trophic levels
  (<xref alt="Blüthgen et al. 2007" rid="ref-bluthgen2007specialization" ref-type="bibr">Blüthgen

  Menzel, and Blüthgen 2006</xref>). While high levels of network
  specialization represent networks predominantly made of “one-to-one”
  interactions, low levels of network specialization represent networks
  with species showing predominantly “one-to-many” interactions
  (<xref alt="Blüthgen, Menzel, and Blüthgen 2006" rid="ref-bluthgen2006measuring" ref-type="bibr">Blüthgen,

  <xref alt="Blüthgen and Klein 2011" rid="ref-bluthgen2011functional" ref-type="bibr">Blüthgen
  and Klein 2011</xref>) (Figure 1B). One highly expected outcome is
  that when functional trophic asymmetry is high, networks will have low
  specialization. For example, take a plant community exhibiting a low
  richness of flower displays and which is associated with a bee
  community (pollinators) exhibiting a wide variety of proboscis
  lengths. These plants are unlikely to form “one-to-one” interactions
  with only a subset of bee species that have matching proboscis length.
  Otherwise, non-matching pollinators would have no food resource and be
  extirpated. By partitioning deviations from expected FTA and network
  specialization relationships with null models, one can separate the
  relative influences of processes operating between trophic levels
  (e.g. trait matching) and those within trophic levels
  (e.g. environmental selection) in network assembly
  (<xref alt="Marjakangas et al. 2022" rid="ref-marjakangas2022trait" ref-type="bibr">Marjakangas
  et al. 2022</xref>). However, the relationship between network
  specialization and functional trophic asymmetry has not been fully
  explored.</p>
  <p>Preserving mutualistic interactions between palms and their
  mammalian frugivores is important to sustain biodiversity and
  ecosystem function in the tropics

  the dispersal of palm fruits, which helps to prevent local extinctions
  amid disturbance and to maintain biodiversity in these ecological
  networks

  richness of palm and frugivore assemblages along environmental
  gradients is a first step in this direction. Here, we ask (1) which
  climatic variable(s) best explains variation in the functional
  richness of palms vs mammal frugivores, (2) whether differences in
  these relationships lead to functional trophic asymmetry, (3) where
  does functional asymmetry peaks in the Neotropics and (4) whether
  asymmetry relates to network specialization.</p>

      (<xref alt="Terry and Lewis 2020" rid="ref-terry2020finding" ref-type="bibr">Terry

      <title>Downscaling the continental metaweb to generate grid-cell
      level networks</title>
      <p>The digitally availability of primary biodiversity data on
      palms and their mammalian frugivores was imbalanced, with well
      covered data in terms of distribution ranges, followed by well
      covered data on species traits, to a limited number of interaction
      records. Therefore, to downscale our initial metaweb to include
      interactions between between every potentially co-occurring palms
      and mammal frugivore at every gridcell of the Neotropics, we use a
      two fold approach. First, we employed multinomial logistic
      regression models that aimed to predict the species level SBM
      model results (i.e. group affiliations) from species-level trait
      data. We justify the choice of multinomial logistic regression
      models as these can handle the prediction of non-binary outcomes,
      that is in our case, the labeling of SBM groupings per species. We
      fitted separate multinomial models for palms and mammal frugivores
      using a label backpropagation algorithm and a neural network
      engine, with 75% of the data allocated for training and the 25%
      remaining for testing. We used neural networks because they are
      useful when dealing with multicollinearity, as they can learn
      complex and non-linear relationships and interactions among
      predictor variables. This allowed us to separate the relative
      importance of distinct matching traits on SBM group affiliations.
      We extracted variable importance scores based on the combinations
      of the absolute values of the best fit model weights
      (<xref alt="Gevrey, Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003" rid="ref-gevrey2003review" ref-type="bibr">Gevrey,
      Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003</xref>). Second, we considered as local
      pairwise species interaction probabilities as the product of the
      values from the Theta matrix from the SBM model that represent the
      latent interaction probabilities between species pairs within and
      between groups multiplied by their probability of co-occurrence
      (POC) in a gridcell. To represent species’ co-occurrence
      probabilities, we used the reciprocal distance between the
      centroids of species pair ranges within the grid-cell, divided by
      the sum of its range areas within the grid-cell. This implied that
      within each grid cell, species with closer range centroids and
      larger cumulative areas are more likely to co-occur and interact.
      This approach allowed us to recreate synthetic probabilistic
      plant-mammal frugivore networks for each grid-cell across the
      Neotropics, while accounting for the heterogeneity of species
      ranges within each grid.</p>

      <title>Measuring Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) and Network
      Specialization (H2’)</title>
      <p>We computed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) from the results
      of the SBM model fit. Specifically, from the matrices representing
      the incidence of palm or mammal frugivore species in one of the
      SBM groupings. Thus, as our measure of functional richness, we
      calculated the number of species of each taxon across SBM groups
      per grid. Because we had differences in the total number of palm
      and mammal species across grids, we normalized species counts
      within gridcells. We then computed the absolute difference between
      trophic levels to obtain a measure of FTA for each combination of
      SBM groups. Because we had the potential for each palms and
      mammals species at each grid to become affiliated to any of 7 SBM
      groups, and to interact with any species of the opposite trophic
      level within and between groups, we obtained a total of 49
      independent FTA measures for each gridcell, one for each
      palm-mammal group combination.</p>
      <p>We measured network specialization at each grid cell using the
      metric H2’. H2’ is a network-level index that describes the degree
      of specialization of interactions between species
      (<xref alt="Blüthgen et al. 2007" rid="ref-bluthgen2007specialization" ref-type="bibr">Blüthgen

      specialized, meaning that specialist species from one trophic
      level interact with specialist species from the opposite trophic
      level. Low H2’ values indicate networks among generalists, meaning
      that there is a low specificity of interactions between species
      across trophic levels. Because inferred networks varied in their
      network size (i.e., number of unique interactions between palms
      and mammals), we rarefied the computation of H2’to networks of the
      same absolute size per gridcell, resampling networks to the same
      number of pairwise interactions (100) at each grid-cell 999 times
      (<xref alt="Terry and Lewis 2020" rid="ref-terry2020finding" ref-type="bibr">Terry

      and replicated the process 999 independent times to obtain a

    <title>The structure of mutualistic networks between palms and their

    <p>The SBM model organized the continental set of palm and mammal
    species into a matrix sorting species into seven SBM groups and an
    accompanying matrix that quantified interaction probabilities
    between and within groups. In our model, there was a 1.74 fold
    increase in the likelihood of interactions between species within
    SBM groups rather than between SBM groups (Figure 2A). For palms,
    important trait variables that predicted SBM group affiliation were
    palm fruit length, maximum stem height, and palm growth form
    (<italic>Acaulescent</italic> or <italic>Erect</italic>) (Figure
    S3-A). For mammals, important trait variables to predict species
    group affiliations were mammal activity, the logarithm of the
    <italic>body mass</italic>, and percentage of frugivory on diet as
    predictor variables (Figure S3-B). These analysis revealed that SBM
    group assortments represent communities of palms (Figure S4) and
    mammal frugivores (Figure S5) with unique trait combinations within
    the high-dimensional multitrophic spectrum of interaction-relevant
    traits. Our approach to downscale a continental metaweb was able to
    generate probabilistic networks between palms and mammalian
    frugivores for 1,072 grid cells acrosss the Neotropics. Each network
    had in average nine interaction partners per species (sd = 5.62), 27
    mammals per grid cell (sd = 14.97), and 11 palms per grid cell (sd =
    11.42).</p>

    <p>FTA z-scores (Figure 2B) indicate that in average FTA was less
    than the FTA expected in a null model. Out of the 49 SBM group
    combinations, those with less than expected asymmetries are
    generally between palms in groups 1, 2, and 5 and mammals in groups
    6 and 3. Conversely, combinations with significantly greater than
    expected asymmetries are generally found between palms in SBM groups
    6 and 4 and mammals in SBM groups 1, 2, and 5. FTA peaks in tropical
    and mountainous regions while being lower in more temperate areas of
    the Neotropics, and remains stable throughout tropical and humid
    regions (Figure 2A). The results of our linear model shows
    significant differences in FTA among SBM groups. In addition, it
    shows a relationship between the spatial variation of climate and
    FTA. However, the significance and direction of effects vary as a
    function of the SBM group combinations (Figure 2B, Table 1). While
    the overall fixed model estimates do not show significant effects of
    climatic variation in FTA across all SBM group combinations [Temp
    (Mean annual temperature) ( 𝞫 =0.0051, p=0.859), Prec (Total annual
    precipitation) ( 𝞫 =−0.0364 p=0.384), TS (Temperature Seasonality)
    (𝞫 =−0.0180 p=0.746), and PS (Precipitation Seasonality) (𝞫 =−0.0507
    p=0.250)]; for specific group combinations, FTA is significantly
    predicted by climate, particularly by changes in Precipitation
    Seasonality (Figure S6). Approximately 59% of the variability in the
    FTA z-score is explained by the linear model with our climate
    predictors as fixed effects and SBM group identity as interaction
    terms (adjusted R-squared = 0.59).</p>
    <p>On one hand, group combinations exhibiting a positive
    relationship between FTA and precipitation seasonality are
    characterized by a relatively stable functional richness of mammals
    across gradients of precipitation seasonality, while the functional
    richness of palms increases under these conditions (Figures S6, S7).
    A significant portion of this pattern can be attributed to turnover
    within the palm community of SBM group 6, which predominantly
    consists of small to medium-sized drupes or berries. These palms,
    which belong to genera such as <italic>Acrocomia</italic>,
    <italic>Allagoptera</italic>, and <italic>Astrocaryum</italic> are
    typically of tropical origin and display diverse growth forms,
    including both erect and acaulescent. Conversely, group combinations
    showing a negative association between FTA and precipitation
    seasonality are primarily driven by patterns in the palm community
    of SBM group 5 (Figures S6, S7). In this scenario, while the
    functional richness of mammals remains stable, the functional
    richness of these palms, generally characterized by species with
    erect growth forms and large fruits, increases in regions with low
    precipitation seasonality.</p>

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>Our approach unveils novel insights into the assembly of
  mutualistic networks by making use of digitally available primary
  biodiversity data at broad scales. By identifying species of palms and
  mammals with similar interaction patterns, we can offer a more nuanced
  understanding of network assembly dynamics within these multitrophic
  communities. The observed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) across
  different climatic regions of the Neotropics underscores the
  importance of contemporary climate change in shaping interaction
  niches across species’ distributional rangespation in precipitation
  seasonality emerging as a key predictor of FTA in certain SBM palm and
  mammal group combinations, where higher FTA increase overall network
  specialization.</p>
  <p>The delineation of interactions into distinct groups indicates
  that, at a continental scale, the network of seed dispersal
  interactions is highly compartmentalized. This finding aligns with
  previous work reporting significant modularity in palm seed dispersal
  interactions across the Neotropical continent. Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard,
  and Kissling
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-munoz2019synthesis" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  In our study, we extend this understanding by identifying palm growth
  form and mammal foraging activity periods as key palm and animal
  traits driving this broad scale modularity through changes in
  functional richness. While our analysis revealed a higher probability
  of pairwise species interactions occurring within Stochastic Block
  Model (SBM) groups, interactions between SBM groups are not at all
  improbable. The observed distribution of interaction probabilities
  within and between SBM groups highlights multitrophic assemblages
  being central to the entire metaweb, notably the palm and mammal
  species in SBM groups 5 and 6, which are those with extensive
  distributional ranges and more generalist diets. Conversely, it also
  identifies peripheral groups, such as species in SBM groups 1-3, which
  exhibit narrower interaction niches. These peripheral species
  assemblages which may correspond to those species with restricted
  ranges or specialized diets. Indeed, SBM groups 5-6 include larger,
  nocturnal mammals that feed on palms with varying fruit sizes and
  growth forms, ranging from erect to acaulescent, whereas SBM groups
  1-3 predominantly consist of smaller, diurnal mammals that consume
  small fruits from erect palms.</p>
  <p>Communities of similarly interacting species obtained from SBM
  models have been shown to reflect ecological factors, such as the
  spatio-temporal segregation of species assemblages and the
  differentiation of interaction niches Durand-Bessart et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-durand2023trait" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
  . Our linear model highlights Precipitation Seasonality as a key
  factor influencing Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) across SBM
  groupings. This suggests that spatial variation in interaction niches
  emerges from the differences in the strength of environmental
  selection between trophic levels. Such uneven pressures result in
  multitrophic assemblages where not all trait combinations align
  optimally with the global preferences of their co-occurring
  interaction partners, thus contributing to promote structural
  diversity in seed dispersal networks across Neotropical sites. For
  example, mammalian frugivores, which can exhibit a broad tolerance for
  varying levels of precipitation seasonality, may predominantly consume
  small-fruited palms in regions with high precipitation seasonality.
  This is likely because palms with smaller fruits are better adapted to
  thrive under conditions of variable water availability. Consequently,
  this ecological scenario is expected to result in increased FTA,
  driven by the restricted functional richness of available resources
  for consumers. Similarly, palms with larger fruit sizes and
  predominantly erect growth forms consumed by large sized frugivores
  might reflect adaptations to attract high quality animal seed
  disperses in environments where consistent water availability promotes
  higher habitat complexity and plant competition. Consequently, this
  ecological scenario is expected to result in increased FTA, driven by
  the restricted functional richness of available consumers relative to
  producers. In both cases, FTA imposes limits over trait matching
  between partners of distinct trophic levels and the partitioning of
  interaction niches within species of the same trophic level.</p>
  <p>Having a low degree of specialization in palm-mammal frugivore seed
  dispersal networks is not entirely unexpected given the historical
  ecological shifts that these species have experienced in the
  Neotropics. Unlike other major tropical regions, such as the
  Afrotropics and South-East Asia, the Neotropics had significant
  post-Pleistocene extinctions, which heavily altered mammalian
  communities. These extinctions, which impacted disproportionately to
  mammal megafauna, likely exacerbate competition and extinction rates
  among their large-fruited palm partners, particularly in those regions
  with high mammal diversity and endemism. Webb

  further contributed to the decoupling of trait diversity between palms
  and mammals and the re-structuring of seed dispersal networks across
  trophic levels in the Neotropics. Without this trait decoupling due
  the co-evolutionary dynamics between palms and mammal frugivores may
  have remained unaltered, fostering otherwise more specialized
  networks.</p>
  <p>The positive estimate for mean FTA suggests a strong positive
  influence of FTA on H2’, thus promoting network specialization. In
  contrast, the negative estimate for FTA standard deviation (SD)
  indicates that a large variation in FTA within SBM group combinations
  significantly reduces H2’, implying more generalist interactions. This
  suggest, that while overall higher FTA promotes network
  specialization, an inconsistent FTA across SBM groups can disrupt this
  pattern, making network structure less predictable from multitrophic
  trait patterns. Previous research in insular regions where trophic
  communities are often subject to asymmetric filtering strengths have
  shown that the specialization of mutualistic networks can indeed be
  resilient to shifts in the degree of ecological filters between
  trophic levels. Particularly, if the networks are well supported by
  generalist species
  (<xref alt="Schleuning et al. 2012" rid="ref-schleuning2012specialization" ref-type="bibr">Schleuning

  <xref alt="Schleuning et al. 2016" rid="ref-schleuning2016ecological" ref-type="bibr">Schleuning
  et al. 2016</xref>). It is therefore critical to consider changes in
  the underlying network structure when evaluating potential effects
  that climate-driven species or species trait losses have in ecosystem
  function Classen et al.

  <p>We validated the statistic significance of the model parameters
  through null simulations of network assembly,. However, it is
  noteworthy that our null models are limited to presence/absence
  permutations. Therefore, the potential influence of varying species
  relative abundances across sites was not considered in this study. It
  is well established that population-density dependent effects can
  modify interaction probabilities from trait matching and range
  co-occurrences [ Peña et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-pena2023abundance" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>),

  McFadden et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mcfadden2022global" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)]
  Future studies should aim to incorporate species abundance estimates
  when defining interaction probabilities. However, despite ongoing
  efforts, such data is not readily available for multiple species at
  different trophic levels, and at broad spatial scales. Our results
  help elucidate mechanisms that contribute towards a broader theory of
  multitrophic community assembly. However, given the current limitation
  in obtaining reliable species abundance data, we advise caution when
  utilizing our data pipelines for making finer-scale spatial
  predictions of network assembly and interaction diversity. Similarly,
  the use biogeographic domains to delineate the species pools in the
  construction of our null models respects ecological theory and
  considers both historical and regional species pools [McFadden et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mcfadden2022global" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>),

  Cornell and Harrison
  (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-cornell2014species" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)].
  However, one critical assumption of this approach is that species
  within each biogeographic dominion are all equally likely to colonize
  a given community [Lessard et al.

  While this assumption may simplify the computational complexity of our
  algorithms, future work could penalize dispersal distances with
  landscape level variables such as the slope terrain [Préau et al.

  Finally, the clustering of interactions captured by the SBM may be
  also capturing reveal relatively unexplored drivers of interaction
  assembly, such as phylogenetic niche conservatism [Ackerly

  Pyron et al.
  (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-pyron2015phylogenetic" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>)],
  where closely related species retain similar ecological traits over
  evolutionary time, and/or the widespread extinctions of large mammals
  frugivores and the rapid trait speciation of small fruited palms

  influences in delineating SBM group assignments can be future research
  avenues to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind
  mutualistic interaction patterns in space and time.</p>
  <p>Unraveling the complexity of network assembly processes across
  broad spatial scales requires continous development and refining of
  statistical workflows and biodiversity data pipelines that integrate
  digitally available data from diverse sources
  (<xref alt="Kissling et al. 2012" rid="ref-kissling2012towards" ref-type="bibr">Kissling
  et al. 2012</xref>;
  <xref alt="Thuiller et al. 2024" rid="ref-thuiller2024navigating" ref-type="bibr">Thuiller
  et al. 2024</xref>) Continued field collection, their open-release,
  and data standardization is crucial if we want to expand our capacity
  to training models capable of predicting ecological network structures
  at a global scale with a high degree of spatial and/or temporal
  resolution(<xref alt="Poisot, Stouffer, and Kéfi 2016" rid="ref-poisot2016describe" ref-type="bibr">Poisot,
  Stouffer, and Kéfi 2016</xref>;
  <xref alt="Poisot et al. 2021" rid="ref-poisot2021global" ref-type="bibr">Poisot
  et al. 2021</xref>). While many of these modelling approaches are in
  early development, their success hinges on the availability and
  reliability of foundational data. We have demonstrated that with
  sparse data across large scales, novel models can indeed be developed.
  Filling global data gaps and leveling data completeness across species
  ranges, traits, and interactions can certainly enhance predictive
  accuracy. While our case study has a history of digitally available
  natural history data on both palms and mammal frugivores, such
  comprehensive datasets are not available for many other tropical
  clades. We thus advocate for increased awareness, action, and funding
  for global biodiversity programs that collect and digitize natural
  records, thus enabling the continous development of large-scale
  spatially explicit predictive models that inform about mechanisms of
  network assembly, and their relationship to climate and ecosystem
  function.</p>

      <caption><p>This conceptual model illustrates the dynamic
      relationship between functional diversity metrics—specifically
      Functional Richness (FR) and Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA)—and
      environmental gradients within ecological networks. The left panel
      of <bold>Figure A</bold> visualizes the variation in FR for
      producers (depicted in green) and consumers (depicted in orange)
      along an environmental gradient. As the environmental gradient
      intensifies (e.g., through changes in temperature, precipitation,
      or habitat fragmentation), FR for both producers and consumers
      generally declines. However, this decline can occur at different
      rates, leading to two scenarios: (1) <bold>Differential Decline in
      FR</bold>: If consumer FR declines more sharply than producer FR,
      a substantial increase in Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA) occurs.
      (2) <bold>Parallel Decline in FR</bold>: Alternatively, if both
      producer and consumer FRs decline at a similar rate, FTA remains
      relatively constant along the gradient. This scenario indicates a
      balanced impact of environmental changes across trophic levels,
      preserving the relative functional relationship between producers
      and consumers. <bold>Figure B</bold> shifts focus to the
      implications of changing FTA on network specialization—a measure
      of how distinct or generalized interactions are between producers
      and consumers within ecological networks. <bold>Higher
      Specialization</bold>: This scenario, shown on the left side of
      the gradient, involves more distinct producer-consumer
      interactions, where specific consumer species interact with
      particular producer species. This high specialization often
      correlates with low FTA, where the functional traits between
      interacting species are closely aligned. <bold>Lower
      Specialization</bold>: As environmental stress increases, leading
      to a higher FTA, the network may shift towards lower
      specialization. In this state, interactions become more
      generalized, with consumers utilizing a broader range of producers
      due to the loss of specific functional traits.</p></caption>

<abstract>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> Functional traits are often used to infer the
ecological processes that determine the composition of species
assemblages. However, most trait-based approaches to infer community
assembly processes focus on a single trophic level. Owing to the
matching of traits facilitating interactions between resource and
consumer assemblages, the functional trait diversity of different
trophic levels is expected to covary in space. However, differential
response of consumers and producers to environmental gradients can cause
a decoupling of functional diversity between trophic levels, which we
coin functional trophic asymmetry. Here, we develop a metric to quantify
functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) and use it to infer the processes
underpinning multitrophic community assembly, and explore the role of
these processes in shaping the topology of ecological networks.</p>
<p><bold>Location:</bold> Neotropics.</p>
<p><bold>Time period:</bold> Present.</p>
<p><bold>Major taxa:</bold> Mammalian frugivores and palms.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We use digitally available data on the
functional traits, pairwise mutualistic interactions, and geographic
distributions of consumers (mammalian frugivores) and their producers
(palms) to quantify functional trophic asymmetry for species occurring
in the Neotropics. To cover major data gaps between species-level trait
and interaction data, we train machine learning models to generate
synthetic network data. We then use linear regression models to relate
functional asymmetry to variation in climate, and to assess the
influence of functional asymmetry on network specialization.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Our approach generated probabilistic networks
across 1,072 grid cells in the Neotropics, revealing networks with a
clearly defined modular structure and substantial differences in their
functional richness across trophic levels. Functional trophic asymmetry
increases from regions of the Neotropics with low precipitation
seasonality to regions with high precipitation seasonality. Along this
same climatic gradient, network specialization is positively related to
functional trophic asymmetry.</p>
<p><bold>Main conclusions:</bold> Our results further suggest that
mutualistic interactions between palms and mammals are mediated by
matching traits and taxonomic overlap as a key assembly process at the
regional scale. We conclude that increased warming and seasonal shifts
in precipitation caused by global climate change could
disproportionately impact specialist species while increasing functional
trophic asymmetry in ecological networks.</p>

  their resources, modulated by their degree of reciprocal dependency or
  co-evolution

  <p>Inferring the relative strength of environmental selection between
  trophic levels requires using high-dimensional approaches that are
  able to deal with sparse observations for a large number of species

  <xref alt="Strydom et al. 2022" rid="ref-strydom2022food-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Strydom
  et al. 2022</xref>). We introduce the concept of functional trophic
  asymmetry (FTA), which allows inferring the relative influence of
  environmental selection and trait matching on the composition of
  multitrophic assemblages
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Figure%201">(Figure
  1)</ext-link>. FTA is the difference in the richness of
  interaction-relevant traits between trophic levels in a multitrophic
  network. FTA can occur because traits mediating species interactions
  (i.e., interaction niches) across trophic levels can also mediate the
  responses of species to their abiotic environment (i.e. environmental
  niches)

  Golovina, and Buitink 2001</xref>). High FTA could indicate
  differences in the strength of environmental selection over the
  interaction niches of distinct trophic levels within a multitrophic
  species assemblage. Alternatively, low FTA could indicate that the
  strength of the environment selection shaping interaction niches is
  similar between trophic levels, e.g. equally weak or equally strong
  (<xref alt="Marjakangas et al. 2022" rid="ref-marjakangas2022trait-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Marjakangas
  et al. 2022</xref>). When interactions between producers and consumers
  are mutualistic, low FTA could also emerge under strong trait matching
  and therefore indicate the influence of trait-coevolution during
  multitrophic community assembly

  that when functional trophic asymmetry is high, networks will have low
  specialization. For example, take a plant community exhibiting a low
  richness of flower displays and which is associated with a bee
  community (pollinators) exhibiting a wide variety of proboscis
  lengths. These plants are unlikely to form “one-to-one” interactions
  with only a subset of bee species that have matching proboscis length.
  Otherwise, non-matching pollinators would have no food resource and be
  extirpated. By partitioning deviations from expected FTA and network
  specialization relationships with null models, one can separate the
  relative influences of processes operating between trophic levels
  (e.g. trait matching) and those within trophic levels

      <p>The digitally availability of primary biodiversity data on
      palms and their mammalian frugivores was imbalanced, with well
      covered data in terms of distribution ranges, followed by well
      covered data on species traits, to a limited number of interaction
      records. Therefore, to downscale our initial metaweb to include
      interactions between between every potentially co-occurring palms
      and mammal frugivore at every gridcell of the Neotropics, we use a
      two fold approach. First, we employed multinomial logistic
      regression models that aimed to predict the species level SBM
      model results (i.e. group affiliations) from species-level trait
      data. We justify the choice of multinomial logistic regression
      models as these can handle the prediction of non-binary outcomes,
      that is in our case, the labeling of SBM groupings per species. We
      fitted separate multinomial models for palms and mammal frugivores
      using a label backpropagation algorithm and a neural network
      engine, with 75% of the data allocated for training and the 25%
      remaining for testing. We used neural networks because they are
      useful when dealing with multicollinearity, as they can learn
      complex and non-linear relationships and interactions among
      predictor variables. This allowed us to separate the relative
      importance of distinct matching traits on SBM group affiliations.
      We extracted variable importance scores based on the combinations
      of the absolute values of the best fit model weights
      (<xref alt="Gevrey, Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003" rid="ref-gevrey2003review-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Gevrey,
      Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003</xref>). Second, we considered as local
      pairwise species interaction probabilities as the product of the
      values from the Theta matrix from the SBM model that represent the
      latent interaction probabilities between species pairs within and
      between groups multiplied by their probability of co-occurrence
      (POC) in a gridcell. To represent species’ co-occurrence
      probabilities, we used the reciprocal distance between the
      centroids of species pair ranges within the grid-cell, divided by
      the sum of its range areas within the grid-cell. This implied that
      within each grid cell, species with closer range centroids and
      larger cumulative areas are more likely to co-occur and interact.
      This approach allowed us to recreate synthetic probabilistic
      plant-mammal frugivore networks for each grid-cell across the
      Neotropics, while accounting for the heterogeneity of species
      ranges within each grid.</p>

      <p>We computed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) from the results

      the incidence of palm or mammal frugivore species in one of the
      SBM groupings. Thus, as our measure of functional richness, we
      calculated the number of species of each taxon across SBM groups
      per grid. Because we had differences in the total number of palm
      and mammal species across grids, we normalized species counts
      within gridcells. We then computed the absolute difference between
      trophic levels to obtain a measure of FTA for each combination of
      SBM groups. Because we had the potential for each palms and
      mammals species at each grid to become affiliated to any of 7 SBM
      groups, and to interact with any species of the opposite trophic
      level within and between groups, we obtained a total of 49
      independent FTA measures for each gridcell, one for each
      palm-mammal group combination.</p>
      <p>We measured network specialization at each grid cell using the
      metric H2’. H2’ is a network-level index that describes the degree

      specialized, meaning that specialist species from one trophic
      level interact with specialist species from the opposite trophic
      level. Low H2’ values indicate networks among generalists, meaning
      that there is a low specificity of interactions between species
      across trophic levels. Because inferred networks varied in their
      network size (i.e., number of unique interactions between palms
      and mammals), we rarefied the computation of H2’to networks of the
      same absolute size per gridcell, resampling networks to the same

    <p>The SBM model organized the continental set of palm and mammal
    species into a matrix sorting species into seven SBM groups and an
    accompanying matrix that quantified interaction probabilities
    between and within groups. In our model, there was a 1.74 fold
    increase in the likelihood of interactions between species within
    SBM groups rather than between SBM groups (Figure 2A). For palms,
    important trait variables that predicted SBM group affiliation were
    palm fruit length, maximum stem height, and palm growth form
    (<italic>Acaulescent</italic> or <italic>Erect</italic>) (Figure
    S3-A). For mammals, important trait variables to predict species
    group affiliations were mammal activity, the logarithm of the
    <italic>body mass</italic>, and percentage of frugivory on diet as
    predictor variables (Figure S3-B). These analysis revealed that SBM
    group assortments represent communities of palms (Figure S4) and
    mammal frugivores (Figure S5) with unique trait combinations within
    the high-dimensional multitrophic spectrum of interaction-relevant
    traits. Our approach to downscale a continental metaweb was able to
    generate probabilistic networks between palms and mammalian
    frugivores for 1,072 grid cells acrosss the Neotropics. Each network
    had in average nine interaction partners per species (sd = 5.62), 27

    <title>Differences in trait-climate relationships across trophic
    levels lead to Functional Trophic Asymmetry</title>
    <p>FTA z-scores (Figure 2B) indicate that in average FTA was less
    than the FTA expected in a null model. Out of the 49 SBM group
    combinations, those with less than expected asymmetries are
    generally between palms in groups 1, 2, and 5 and mammals in groups
    6 and 3. Conversely, combinations with significantly greater than
    expected asymmetries are generally found between palms in SBM groups
    6 and 4 and mammals in SBM groups 1, 2, and 5. FTA peaks in tropical
    and mountainous regions while being lower in more temperate areas of
    the Neotropics, and remains stable throughout tropical and humid
    regions (Figure 2A). The results of our linear model shows
    significant differences in FTA among SBM groups. In addition, it
    shows a relationship between the spatial variation of climate and
    FTA. However, the significance and direction of effects vary as a
    function of the SBM group combinations (Figure 2B, Table 1). While
    the overall fixed model estimates do not show significant effects of
    climatic variation in FTA across all SBM group combinations [Temp
    (Mean annual temperature) ( 𝞫 =0.0051, p=0.859), Prec (Total annual
    precipitation) ( 𝞫 =−0.0364 p=0.384), TS (Temperature Seasonality)
    (𝞫 =−0.0180 p=0.746), and PS (Precipitation Seasonality) (𝞫 =−0.0507
    p=0.250)]; for specific group combinations, FTA is significantly
    predicted by climate, particularly by changes in Precipitation
    Seasonality (Figure S6). Approximately 59% of the variability in the
    FTA z-score is explained by the linear model with our climate
    predictors as fixed effects and SBM group identity as interaction
    terms (adjusted R-squared = 0.59).</p>
    <p>On one hand, group combinations exhibiting a positive
    relationship between FTA and precipitation seasonality are
    characterized by a relatively stable functional richness of mammals
    across gradients of precipitation seasonality, while the functional
    richness of palms increases under these conditions (Figures S6, S7).
    A significant portion of this pattern can be attributed to turnover
    within the palm community of SBM group 6, which predominantly
    consists of small to medium-sized drupes or berries. These palms,
    which belong to genera such as <italic>Acrocomia</italic>,
    <italic>Allagoptera</italic>, and <italic>Astrocaryum</italic> are
    typically of tropical origin and display diverse growth forms,
    including both erect and acaulescent. Conversely, group combinations
    showing a negative association between FTA and precipitation
    seasonality are primarily driven by patterns in the palm community
    of SBM group 5 (Figures S6, S7). In this scenario, while the
    functional richness of mammals remains stable, the functional
    richness of these palms, generally characterized by species with
    erect growth forms and large fruits, increases in regions with low
    precipitation seasonality.</p>

    <title>Functional Trophic Asymmetry increases Network
    Specialization</title>
    <p>We found overall, palm-mammalian frugivore networks had low
    specialization, H2’ ranged from 0.12 to 0.25. In addition, there was
    a significant relationship between aggregated gridcell records of
    Functional Trophic Asymmetry and H2’ metric. Specifically, FTA
    z-scores increased H2’ by 3.28 units per mean unit increase across
    all SBM groups. Additionally, the standard deviation of FTA z-scores
    decreased H2’ by 1.01 units per unit increase across all SBM groups
    (SD FTA). While this linear model explained only around 8.7% of the
    total spatial variability in H2’ (adjusted R-squared = 0.087), the
    results of our simulations show that the intercept and slope
    estimates are statistically significant from null assembly models

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>Our approach unveils novel insights into the assembly of
  mutualistic networks by making use of digitally available primary
  biodiversity data at broad scales. By identifying species of palms and
  mammals with similar interaction patterns, we can offer a more nuanced
  understanding of network assembly dynamics within these multitrophic
  communities. The observed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) across
  different climatic regions of the Neotropics underscores the
  importance of contemporary climate change in shaping interaction
  niches across species’ distributional rangespation in precipitation
  seasonality emerging as a key predictor of FTA in certain SBM palm and
  mammal group combinations, where higher FTA increase overall network
  specialization.</p>
  <p>The delineation of interactions into distinct groups indicates
  that, at a continental scale, the network of seed dispersal
  interactions is highly compartmentalized. This finding aligns with
  previous work reporting significant modularity in palm seed dispersal
  interactions across the Neotropical continent. Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard,
  and Kissling
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-munoz2019synthesis-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  In our study, we extend this understanding by identifying palm growth
  form and mammal foraging activity periods as key palm and animal
  traits driving this broad scale modularity through changes in
  functional richness. While our analysis revealed a higher probability
  of pairwise species interactions occurring within Stochastic Block
  Model (SBM) groups, interactions between SBM groups are not at all
  improbable. The observed distribution of interaction probabilities
  within and between SBM groups highlights multitrophic assemblages
  being central to the entire metaweb, notably the palm and mammal
  species in SBM groups 5 and 6, which are those with extensive
  distributional ranges and more generalist diets. Conversely, it also
  identifies peripheral groups, such as species in SBM groups 1-3, which
  exhibit narrower interaction niches. These peripheral species
  assemblages which may correspond to those species with restricted
  ranges or specialized diets. Indeed, SBM groups 5-6 include larger,
  nocturnal mammals that feed on palms with varying fruit sizes and
  growth forms, ranging from erect to acaulescent, whereas SBM groups
  1-3 predominantly consist of smaller, diurnal mammals that consume
  small fruits from erect palms.</p>
  <p>Communities of similarly interacting species obtained from SBM
  models have been shown to reflect ecological factors, such as the
  spatio-temporal segregation of species assemblages and the
  differentiation of interaction niches Durand-Bessart et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-durand2023trait-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
  . Our linear model highlights Precipitation Seasonality as a key
  factor influencing Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) across SBM
  groupings. This suggests that spatial variation in interaction niches
  emerges from the differences in the strength of environmental
  selection between trophic levels. Such uneven pressures result in
  multitrophic assemblages where not all trait combinations align
  optimally with the global preferences of their co-occurring
  interaction partners, thus contributing to promote structural
  diversity in seed dispersal networks across Neotropical sites. For
  example, mammalian frugivores, which can exhibit a broad tolerance for
  varying levels of precipitation seasonality, may predominantly consume
  small-fruited palms in regions with high precipitation seasonality.
  This is likely because palms with smaller fruits are better adapted to
  thrive under conditions of variable water availability. Consequently,
  this ecological scenario is expected to result in increased FTA,
  driven by the restricted functional richness of available resources
  for consumers. Similarly, palms with larger fruit sizes and
  predominantly erect growth forms consumed by large sized frugivores
  might reflect adaptations to attract high quality animal seed
  disperses in environments where consistent water availability promotes
  higher habitat complexity and plant competition. Consequently, this
  ecological scenario is expected to result in increased FTA, driven by
  the restricted functional richness of available consumers relative to
  producers. In both cases, FTA imposes limits over trait matching
  between partners of distinct trophic levels and the partitioning of
  interaction niches within species of the same trophic level.</p>
  <p>Having a low degree of specialization in palm-mammal frugivore seed
  dispersal networks is not entirely unexpected given the historical
  ecological shifts that these species have experienced in the
  Neotropics. Unlike other major tropical regions, such as the
  Afrotropics and South-East Asia, the Neotropics had significant
  post-Pleistocene extinctions, which heavily altered mammalian
  communities. These extinctions, which impacted disproportionately to
  mammal megafauna, likely exacerbate competition and extinction rates
  among their large-fruited palm partners, particularly in those regions
  with high mammal diversity and endemism. Webb

  Concurrently, the radiation of small-fruited palm taxa Onstein et al.
  (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-onstein2014diversification-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>);
  Onstein et al.
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-onstein2017frugivory-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
  further contributed to the decoupling of trait diversity between palms
  and mammals and the re-structuring of seed dispersal networks across
  trophic levels in the Neotropics. Without this trait decoupling due
  the co-evolutionary dynamics between palms and mammal frugivores may
  have remained unaltered, fostering otherwise more specialized
  networks.</p>
  <p>The positive estimate for mean FTA suggests a strong positive
  influence of FTA on H2’, thus promoting network specialization. In
  contrast, the negative estimate for FTA standard deviation (SD)
  indicates that a large variation in FTA within SBM group combinations
  significantly reduces H2’, implying more generalist interactions. This
  suggest, that while overall higher FTA promotes network
  specialization, an inconsistent FTA across SBM groups can disrupt this
  pattern, making network structure less predictable from multitrophic
  trait patterns. Previous research in insular regions where trophic
  communities are often subject to asymmetric filtering strengths have
  shown that the specialization of mutualistic networks can indeed be
  resilient to shifts in the degree of ecological filters between
  trophic levels. Particularly, if the networks are well supported by
  generalist species
  (<xref alt="Schleuning et al. 2012" rid="ref-schleuning2012specialization-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Schleuning
  et al. 2012</xref> ;
  <xref alt="Schleuning et al. 2016" rid="ref-schleuning2016ecological-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Schleuning
  et al. 2016</xref>). It is therefore critical to consider changes in
  the underlying network structure when evaluating potential effects
  that climate-driven species or species trait losses have in ecosystem
  function Classen et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-classen2020specialization-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)</p>
  <p>We validated the statistic significance of the model parameters
  through null simulations of network assembly,. However, it is
  noteworthy that our null models are limited to presence/absence
  permutations. Therefore, the potential influence of varying species
  relative abundances across sites was not considered in this study. It
  is well established that population-density dependent effects can
  modify interaction probabilities from trait matching and range
  co-occurrences [ Peña et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-pena2023abundance-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>),
  Donoso et al.
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-donoso2017complementary-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>),
  McFadden et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mcfadden2022global-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)]
  Future studies should aim to incorporate species abundance estimates
  when defining interaction probabilities. However, despite ongoing
  efforts, such data is not readily available for multiple species at
  different trophic levels, and at broad spatial scales. Our results
  help elucidate mechanisms that contribute towards a broader theory of
  multitrophic community assembly. However, given the current limitation
  in obtaining reliable species abundance data, we advise caution when
  utilizing our data pipelines for making finer-scale spatial
  predictions of network assembly and interaction diversity. Similarly,
  the use biogeographic domains to delineate the species pools in the
  construction of our null models respects ecological theory and
  considers both historical and regional species pools [McFadden et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mcfadden2022global-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>),

  (<xref alt="2013" rid="ref-carstensen2013introducing-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>),
  Cornell and Harrison
  (<xref alt="2014" rid="ref-cornell2014species-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)].
  However, one critical assumption of this approach is that species
  within each biogeographic dominion are all equally likely to colonize
  a given community [Lessard et al.
  (<xref alt="2012" rid="ref-lessard2012inferring-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)]
  While this assumption may simplify the computational complexity of our
  algorithms, future work could penalize dispersal distances with
  landscape level variables such as the slope terrain [Préau et al.
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-preau2022dispersal-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>);
  Schlägel et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-schlagel2020movement-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)].
  Finally, the clustering of interactions captured by the SBM may be
  also capturing reveal relatively unexplored drivers of interaction
  assembly, such as phylogenetic niche conservatism [Ackerly

  Pyron et al.
  (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-pyron2015phylogenetic-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>)],
  where closely related species retain similar ecological traits over
  evolutionary time, and/or the widespread extinctions of large mammals
  frugivores and the rapid trait speciation of small fruited palms

  <xref alt="Onstein et al. 2017" rid="ref-onstein2017frugivory-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Onstein
  et al. 2017</xref>) . Partitioning these aspects and their relative
  influences in delineating SBM group assignments can be future research
  avenues to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind
  mutualistic interaction patterns in space and time.</p>
  <p>Unraveling the complexity of network assembly processes across
  broad spatial scales requires continous development and refining of
  statistical workflows and biodiversity data pipelines that integrate
  digitally available data from diverse sources
  (<xref alt="Kissling et al. 2012" rid="ref-kissling2012towards-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Kissling
  et al. 2012</xref>;
  <xref alt="Thuiller et al. 2024" rid="ref-thuiller2024navigating-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Thuiller
  et al. 2024</xref>) Continued field collection, their open-release,
  and data standardization is crucial if we want to expand our capacity
  to training models capable of predicting ecological network structures
  at a global scale with a high degree of spatial and/or temporal
  resolution(<xref alt="Poisot, Stouffer, and Kéfi 2016" rid="ref-poisot2016describe-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Poisot,

  <xref alt="Poisot et al. 2021" rid="ref-poisot2021global-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Poisot
  et al. 2021</xref>). While many of these modelling approaches are in
  early development, their success hinges on the availability and
  reliability of foundational data. We have demonstrated that with
  sparse data across large scales, novel models can indeed be developed.
  Filling global data gaps and leveling data completeness across species
  ranges, traits, and interactions can certainly enhance predictive
  accuracy. While our case study has a history of digitally available
  natural history data on both palms and mammal frugivores, such
  comprehensive datasets are not available for many other tropical
  clades. We thus advocate for increased awareness, action, and funding
  for global biodiversity programs that collect and digitize natural
  records, thus enabling the continous development of large-scale
  spatially explicit predictive models that inform about mechanisms of
  network assembly, and their relationship to climate and ecosystem
  function.</p>

      <caption><p>This conceptual model illustrates the dynamic
      relationship between functional diversity metrics—specifically
      Functional Richness (FR) and Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA)—and
      environmental gradients within ecological networks. The left panel

      producers (depicted in green) and consumers (depicted in orange)
      along an environmental gradient. As the environmental gradient
      intensifies (e.g., through changes in temperature, precipitation,
      or habitat fragmentation), FR for both producers and consumers
      generally declines. However, this decline can occur at different
      rates, leading to two scenarios: (1) <bold>Differential Decline in
      FR</bold>: If consumer FR declines more sharply than producer FR,
      a substantial increase in Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA) occurs.
      (2) <bold>Parallel Decline in FR</bold>: Alternatively, if both
      producer and consumer FRs decline at a similar rate, FTA remains
      relatively constant along the gradient. This scenario indicates a
      balanced impact of environmental changes across trophic levels,
      preserving the relative functional relationship between producers
      and consumers. <bold>Figure B</bold> shifts focus to the
      implications of changing FTA on network specialization—a measure
      of how distinct or generalized interactions are between producers
      and consumers within ecological networks. <bold>Higher
      Specialization</bold>: This scenario, shown on the left side of
      the gradient, involves more distinct producer-consumer
      interactions, where specific consumer species interact with
      particular producer species. This high specialization often
      correlates with low FTA, where the functional traits between
      interacting species are closely aligned. <bold>Lower
      Specialization</bold>: As environmental stress increases, leading
      to a higher FTA, the network may shift towards lower
      specialization. In this state, interactions become more
      generalized, with consumers utilizing a broader range of producers
      due to the loss of specific functional traits.</p></caption>

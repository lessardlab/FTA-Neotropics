Whereas most trait-based approaches to infer community assembly processes focus on a single trophic level, traits also mediate interactions between trophic levels.  Owing to the matching of traits facilitating interactions between resource and consumer assemblages, the functional trait diversity of different trophic levels is expected to covary in space. However, the differential response of consumers and producers to environmental gradients can cause a decoupling of functional diversity between trophic levels, which we coin functional trophic asymmetry. Here, we develop a metric to quantify functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) and use it to infer the processes underpinning multitrophic community assembly and explore the role of these processes in shaping the topology of ecological networks.\n  \n  **Location:** Neotropics.\n  \n  **Time period:** Present.\n  \n  **Major taxa:** Mammalian frugivores and palms.\n  \n  **Methods:** We used digitally available data on the functional traits, pairwise mutualistic interactions, and geographic distributions of consumers (mammalian frugivores) and their producers (palms) to quantify FTA for species assemblages occurring in the Neotropics. To cover major data gaps between species-level trait and interaction data at finer spatial grain, we trained machine learning models to downscale the continental meta-network to grid cell-level networks. For each grid-cell, we also estimated FTA for all combinations of interaction guilds. These guilds were defined as distinct subsets of producer and consumer assemblages playing similar roles within mutualistic networks and sharing partners in the other trophic level. We then use generalized additive models to relate geographic variation in FTA to variation in climatic variables and assessed whether the strength of these relationship varied among pairwise interaction guilds. Finally, we then examined the relationship between FTA and network specialization.\n  \n  **Results:** By downscaling the continental metaweb, we generated probabilistic networks across 1,072 grid cells in the Neotropics. Our modelling approach identified 7 consumer and 7 producer interaction guilds. Assemblage-wide FTA is negatively related to annual mean temperatures across the neotropics. When considering individual interaction guilds, precipitation seasonality is positively related to FTA. This relationship between FTA and precipitation seasonality was stronger for consumer and producer guild combinations with high predicted interaction strength. Finally, network specialization was positively  related to FTA, regardless of the interaction guild combination.\n  \n  **Main conclusions:** Mutualistic networks in warm regions with seasonal rainfalls, where the environment imposes a disproportionately strong selective pressure on palms relative to mammal frugivores, exhibit higher levels of functional trophic asymmetry. This relationship is particularly strong when considering guilds predicted to strongly interact in nature.  Assemblages exhibiting high FTA also tend to have high levels of network specialization, suggesting that differences in the strength of environmental selection among trophic levels favor the persistence of specialist species in these mutualistic interaction networks.    We therefore conclude that future increases in temperature and the magnitude of precipitation seasonality caused by global climate change could lead to more specialized mutualistic networks which are more prone to collapse when facing further threats and local extinctions.\nauthor:\n  - name: Gabriel Munoz\n    orcid: 0000-0002-0760-5497\n    corresponding: true\n    email: gabrielmunoz1891@gmail.com\n    affiliations:\n      - Concordia University\n  - name: Paul Savary\n    orcid: 0000-0002-0760-5497\n    corresponding: false\n    email: gabrielmunoz1891@gmail.com\n    affiliations:\n      - Concordia University\n  - name: W.

To date, however, trait-based approaches in\necology often focus on a single trophic level, whereas approaches that\nconsider multiple trophic levels remain rare [@lavorel2013novel;\n@seibold2018necessity]. An approach that considers processes operating\nwithin and between trophic levels is necessary to better understand the\nassembly of multitrophic communities[@allesina2008general;\n@marjakangas2022trait; @saravia2022ecological]. Moreover, considering\ntrophic interactions while studying community assembly could shed new\nlight on processes underpinning ecological networks\n[@allesina2008general] .\n\nClassical approaches to study community assembly rely on the concept of\nenvironmental filtering, sorting or selection, where density independent\nconditions constrain the functional richness of species assemblages\n[@laliberte2010distance; @villeger2008new;\n@hillerislambers2012rethinking; @kraft2015community]. Functional\nrichness refers to the variability and relative frequency of different\nfunctional traits observed in a community. It is often used to estimate\nthe strength of selection imposed by the environment\n[@kraft2008functional; @kraft2010functional; @kraft2015community]. High\nfunctional richness can indicate weak environmental selection whereas\nlow functional richness can indicate strong selection\n[@kraft2008functional; @halpern2008functional; @paine2011functional]. In\na multitrophic context, the effects of environmental selection can\ncascade across trophic levels such that selection on consumer traits can\nshape the functional richness of their resources, modulated by their\ndegree of reciprocal dependency or co-evolution [@lavorel2013novel;\n@guzman2019towards]. Moreover, the same environmental gradient could\nexert selective pressures of different strength on communities at\ndistinct trophic levels [@marjakangas2022trait]. Differences in the\nstrength of selective pressure among trophic levels could then possibly\nconstrain the structure or topologies of trophic networks\n[@bluthgen2007specialization; @schleuning2012specialization;\n@dehling2020similar].\n\nInferring the relative strength of environmental selection between\ntrophic levels requires using high-dimensional approaches that are able\nto deal with sparse observations for a large number of species\n[@rohr2010modeling; @strydom2022food]. We introduce the concept of\nfunctional trophic asymmetry (FTA), which allows inferring the relative\ninfluence of environmental selection and trait matching on the\ncomposition of multitrophic assemblages [(Figure 1)](Figure%201). FTA is\nthe difference in the richness of interaction-relevant traits between\ntrophic levels in a multitrophic network. FTA can occur because traits\nmediating species interactions (i.e., interaction niches) across trophic\nlevels can also mediate the responses of species to their abiotic\nenvironment (i.e. environmental niches) [@mccain2014body;\n@moretti2009combining; @nagy2018arthropod; @dehling2020similar]. As an\nexample, plant seed size determine the outcome of animal-mediated seed\ndispersal [@donoso2017complementary; @donoso2020downsizing] as well as\nphysiological limits, such as tolerances of plant seedlings to\ndesiccation [@hoekstra2001mechanisms]. High FTA could indicate\ndifferences in the strength of environmental selection over the\ninteraction niches of distinct trophic levels within a multitrophic\nspecies assemblage. Alternatively, low FTA could indicate that the\nstrength of the environment selection shaping interaction niches is\nsimilar between trophic levels, e.g. equally weak or equally strong\n[@marjakangas2022trait]. When interactions between producers and\nconsumers are mutualistic, low FTA could also emerge under strong trait\nmatching and therefore indicate the influence of trait-coevolution\nduring multitrophic community assembly [@dehling2014functional;\n@albrecht2018plant]. By studying spatial variation in functional trophic\nasymmetry along environmental gradients, we could possibly identify the\nconditions promoting environmentally versus cross-trophic interaction-\ndriven community assembly [@schleuning2020trait; @bello2023analyzing].\n\nFrameworks linking multitrophic functional diversity to network topology\nalong broad-scale environmental gradients are crucial to understand the\neffects of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem function\n[@bello2023analyzing; @dehling2018structure; @schleuning2020trait;\n@schleuning2014ecological; @schleuning2023animal]. Functional responses\nof consumer and producer assemblages to climate influence functional\nrichness at the level of the multitrophic community\n[@garcia2018frugivore]. Because some of these traits are involved in\ninteractions across trophic levels, the filtering of traits along\nenvironmental gradients could constrain the number of unique\ninteractions and therefore, network topology [@marjakangas2022trait;\n@emer2020seed; @albrecht2018plant]. As an example, low multitrophic\nfunctional richness could influence emergent patterns in network\nstructure such as the specialization of multispecies interactions by\nlimiting the relative availability of interaction partners across\ntrophic levels [@bluthgen2007specialization; @bluthgen2006measuring].\nWhile high levels of network specialization represent networks\npredominantly made of “one-to-one” interactions, low levels of network\nspecialization represent networks with species showing predominantly\n“one-to-many” interactions [@bluthgen2006measuring;\n@bluthgen2011functional] (Figure 1B). One highly expected outcome is\nthat when functional trophic asymmetry is high, networks will have low\nspecialization. For example, take a plant community exhibiting a low\nrichness of flower displays and which is associated with a bee community\n(pollinators) exhibiting a wide variety of proboscis lengths. These\nplants are unlikely to form “one-to-one” interactions with only a subset\nof bee species that have matching proboscis length. Otherwise,\nnon-matching pollinators would have no food resource and be extirpated.\nBy partitioning deviations from expected FTA and network specialization\nrelationships with null models, one can separate the relative influences\nof processes operating between trophic levels (e.g. trait matching) and\nthose within trophic levels (e.g. environmental selection) in network\nassembly [@marjakangas2022trait]. However, the relationship between\nnetwork specialization and functional trophic asymmetry has not been\nfully explored.\n\nPreserving mutualistic interactions between palms and their mammalian\nfrugivores is important to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function\nin the tropics [@bogoni2020extent; @marques2022mutualism]. Mammalian\nfrugivores facilitate the dispersal of palm fruits, which helps to\nprevent local extinctions amid disturbance and to maintain biodiversity\nin these ecological networks [@acevedo2020sampling;\n@messeder2020searching; @dehling2018structure]. To effectively preserve\nthese interactions, it is crucial to understand how palm (producer) and\nfrugivore (consumer) communities together respond to environmental\ngradients [@pereira2022priority]. By examining the co-variation in their\nfunctional richness across broad geographic scales and link those\npatterns to spatial and/or temporal variation in climate, we can\nidentify key abiotic factors that influence the assembly of their\nmutualistic relationships [@albrecht2018plant; @schleuning2020trait].\nHere, we ask (1) which climatic variable(s) best explains geographic\nvariation in the functional richness of palms and mammal frugivores, (2)\nwhether differences in these relationships lead to functional trophic\nasymmetry (hereafter FTA), and (3) which climatic variable best explains\ngeographic variation in FTA across the Neotropics. We also ask (4)\nwhether the strength of interactions between palms and mammal frugivores\nthat occupy similar roles in the mutualistic network relates to the\nstrength of the relationship between FTA and climate. Finally, we ask\n(5) whether geographic variation in FTA relates to network\nspecialization.\n\n![**Figure 1:** This conceptual model illustrates the dynamic\nrelationship between functional diversity metrics—specifically\nFunctional Richness (FR) and Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA)—and\nenvironmental gradients within ecological networks. The left panel of\n**Figure A** visualizes the variation in FR for producers (depicted in\ngreen) and consumers (depicted in orange) along an environmental\ngradient. As the environmental gradient intensifies (e.g., through\nchanges in temperature, precipitation, or habitat fragmentation), FR for\nboth producers and consumers generally declines. However, this decline\ncan occur at different rates, leading to two scenarios: (1)\n**Differential Decline in FR**: If consumer FR declines more sharply\nthan producer FR, a substantial increase in Functional Trait Asymmetry\n(FTA) occurs. (2) **Parallel Decline in FR**: Alternatively, if both\nproducer and consumer FRs decline at a similar rate, FTA remains\nrelatively constant along the gradient. This scenario indicates a\nbalanced impact of environmental changes across trophic levels,\npreserving the relative functional relationship between producers and\nconsumers. **Figure B** shifts focus to the implications of changing FTA\non network specialization—a measure of how distinct or generalized\ninteractions are between producers and consumers within ecological\nnetworks. **Higher Specialization**: This scenario, shown on the left\nside of the gradient, involves more distinct producer-consumer\ninteractions, where specific consumer species interact with particular\nproducer species. This high specialization often correlates with low\nFTA, where the functional traits between interacting species are closely\naligned. **Lower Specialization**: As environmental stress increases,\nleading to a higher FTA, the network may shift towards lower\nspecialization. In this state, interactions become more generalized,\nwith consumers utilizing a broader range of producers due to the loss of\nspecific functional\ntraits.](Main_figures/00_Figure1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Methods\n\n## Study system\n\nWe focused on multitrophic communities of Neotropical palms and their\nmutualistic, seed dispersing, mammalian frugivores (Figure S1). Palms\n(Plantae:Arecaceae), being a keystone plant family in tropical regions\n(Kissling et al. 2012; Onstein et al. 2017), provide fruit resources to\na wide variety of vertebrate frugivores, including birds and mammals\n(Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019; Zona and Henderson 1989).\nFrugivore mammals (Animalia:Mammalia) are among the most important\npalm-seed dispersers, particularly over long distances. Most frugivore\nmammals feeding on palms are seed eaters and pulp eaters, dispersing\npalm seeds mostly via ectozoochorus dispersal (Messeder et al. 2020).\nImportantly, frugivory-related traits have notably underlain palm\ndiversification and played a key role in the evolution of palm traits\n(Onstein et al. 2014, 2017)\n\n### Geographic distribution data\n\nWe obtained binary species distribution data (present/absent) on palms\nfrom the geographic range maps of (Bjorholm et al. 2005) and on mammals\nfrom the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) data\nportal. To generate local gridded multitrophic species assemblages\nacross the Neotropics, we intersected the species-level range maps with\na spatial grid where each grid cell represented every 1 by 1 degree\nlatitude and longitude change along the extent of the entire Neotropics.\nWe then listed all palm and mammal frugivore species co-occurring in\neach grid-cell as our grid-cell level multitrophic assemblage.\n\n### Trait data\n\nWe collected species-level multitrophic trait data related to the\nphysiological tolerance of palms and frugivorous mammals to the abiotic\nenvironment and to their mutualistic interactions. For palms, we\nextracted data from the PalmTraits 1.0 dataset (Kissling et al. 2019).\nWe collected data on growth form, maximum stem height, and average fruit\nlength. For frugivorous mammals, we obtained trait data from the\nEltonTraits 1.0 database (Wilman et al. 2014). We selected data on body\nmass, diet, and daily activities. Diet data from the EltonTraits 1.0\ndatabase is coded as percentage use distribution across ten diet\ncategories. We excluded from our analysis species without fruit in their\ndiet. Activity was coded as a dummy variable with three categories\n(Diurnal, Crepuscular, Nocturnal). Finally, body mass was coded as a\nnumerical variable in kg. We excluded bats from the analysis as almost\nno Neotropical bat species is feeding on palm fruits (Messeder et al.\n2020). In total, we subset from this dataset the species with available\ndistribution range map, that is 494 palm species and 737 mammal\nfrugivores.\n\n### Pairwise interaction data\n\nWe used data on seed dispersal interactions between palms and mammals\nfor the Neotropics, originating from recollections of seed dispersal\nrecords found in the published literature and interaction records are\nrecorded at the species level (Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019).\nEach pairwise species interaction record reflects where an article\nmentions the fruit or the seed of a palm being dispersed, carried or\ndefecated by a frugivorous mammal. Interaction records collected in this\ndatabase were previously vetted to reflect effective seed dispersal\ninteractions, while avoiding those that reflect mere seed consumption\n(vetting criteria found in: Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019). In\ntotal, we gathered a total of 581 interaction records between 69 palms\nand 111 frugivore mammals.\n\n### Environmental data\n\nWe used bioclimatic variables from WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans 2017) to\nrepresent large-scale spatial and temporal variation of climate in the\nNeotropics. Specifically, we used mean annual temperature (BIO01), total\nannual precipitation (BIO12), temperature seasonality (BIO04) and\nprecipitation seasonality (BIO15). Using a moving window, we compute\nsimple averages for every set of bioclimatic records at each grid cell,\nthereby re-scaling the spatial resolution of bioclimatic variables to 1\nby 1 degree grid resolution from their original resolution (1 ´ 1 km^2^)\nto match the spatial resolution of our grid cell species-level data.\n\n### Species pool delineation\n\nThe Neotropics is a region with a rich evolutionary history which\nsignificantly influenced patterns of species colonization and extinction\nacross neotropical plant and animal species (Whiteman-Jennings 2015;\nAntonelli and Sanmartı́n 2011).We used the biogeographic regionalization\nof Morrone (2014) to delineate the spatial extent of species pools when\nsimulating network assembly processes. These seven major biogeographic\nregions (i.e., biogeographic dominions) were delineated based on\nevolutionary history, distributional patterns and ecological\ncharacteristics of both plants and animals in the Neotropics.  \n\n## **Statistical analyses**\n\n### *Building a probabilistic continental metaweb from aggregated binary interaction records*\n\nHere, we fitted latent variable network structural models that vary in\ntheir assumptions to estimate interaction probabilities from observed\nbinary data on species interactions. Specifically, we tested: the\nstochastic block model (SBM), the connectance model, the trait-matching\nmodel, and the matching-centrality model (Terry and Lewis 2020). The SBM\nassumes that ecological networks are modular, with species of consumers\ninteracting more within their preferred groups of producers (i.e.,\ninteraction guilds). The outputs of this model are one species-guild\nincidence matrix for palm assemblages, one for mammal assemblages, and a\nguild-guild squared matrix (Theta) for the interaction probabilities\n(i.e. interaction strength) of species within and between guilds. The\nconnectance model posits that interactions of specialist species are\nsubsets of those of generalist species, optimizing connectivity scores\nto recreate observed network patterns. The trait-matching model assumes\nnon-random species interactions determined by trait differences,\noptimizing parameters along latent-trait axes. The matching-centrality\nmodel combines connectivity scores and latent-trait axes (Terry and\nLewis 2020). We fitted these models to our available interaction data\nand selected the model that best predicted the observed continental\npattern of seed dispersal interactions. Using Youden’s J as a metric\nthat balanced model sensitivity and specificity (Poisot 2023), we find\nthat SBM was the best supported model (Figure S2 A-C). Additional\ndetails about the model assumptions are explained in ***Supplementary\nText S1**.*\n\n*Identifying interactions guilds*\n\nAmong all network structural models tested, we found that the\nhyperparameters of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) provided the best\nfit for capturing the observed binary patterns of palm and mammal\nfrugivore interactions in the Neotropics. This suggests that these\nnetworks are highly modular and that certain groups of producers are\nmore likely to interact with certain groups of consumers than others,\nand vice versa.  In this context, we define an *interaction guild* as a\ndistinct group of palm and mammal species within the continental metaweb\nthat exhibits similar interaction patterns. Within each guild, both\nproducer and resource species perform comparable functional roles in the\nnetwork. Within and between each guild combination of consumers and\nproducers, species pairs exhibit the same interaction strength, where\ninteraction strength is defined as the magnitude or intensity of the\neffect that one species has on another within an ecological network.\nHere we estimate interaction strength as the probability that a species\npair would interact in nature.  The SBM estimates such interaction\nprobabilities based on the frequency of interactions observed between\nspecies assigned to given number of consumer or producer guilds. The SBM\nmodel uses maximum likelihood to adjust the number of guilds and the\ndistribution of interaction probabilities within and between guilds such\nthat they best explain the observed pattern of interactions. Using SBMs\nlargely reduces the complexity of dealing with interaction strengths by\ntreating them as a guild-level phenomenon instead of a species-specific\none.  \n\n*Downscaling the continental metaweb to generate grid-cell level\nnetworks*\n\nThe digital availability of primary biodiversity data on palms and their\nmammalian frugivores was imbalanced, with well covered data in terms of\ndistribution ranges and species traits, but a limited number of\ninteraction records. Therefore, to downscale our initial metaweb to\ninclude interactions between every potentially co-occurring palms and\nmammal frugivore at every grid cell of the Neotropics, we use a twofold\napproach. First, we employed multinomial logistic regression models that\naimed to predict the species level SBM model results (i.e. interaction\nguild affiliation) from species-level trait data. We justify the choice\nof multinomial logistic regression models as these can handle the\nprediction of non-binary outcomes, that is in our case, the labeling of\ninteraction guilds per species. We fitted separate multinomial models\nfor palms and mammal frugivores using a label backpropagation algorithm\nand a neural network engine, with 75% of the data allocated for training\nand the 25% remaining for testing. We use neural networks because they\nare useful when dealing with multicollinearity, as they can learn\ncomplex and non-linear relationships and interactions among multiple\npredictor variables. This allowed us to separate the relative importance\nof distinct matching traits on SBM group affiliations. We extracted\nvariable importance scores based on the combinations of the absolute\nvalues of the best fit model weights (Gevrey, Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003).\nWe considered as local pairwise species interaction probabilities as the\nproduct of the values from the Theta matrix from the SBM model that\nrepresent the latent interaction probabilities between species pairs\nwithin and between groups multiplied by their probability of\nco-occurrence (POC) in a grid cell. To represent species’ co-occurrence\nprobabilities, we used the reciprocal distance between the centroids of\nspecies pair ranges within the grid-cell, divided by the sum of its\nrange areas within the grid-cell. This implied that within each grid\ncell, species with closer range centroids and larger cumulative areas\nare more likely to co-occur and interact. This approach allowed us to\nrecreate synthetic probabilistic plant-mammal frugivore networks for\neach grid-cell across the Neotropics, while accounting for the\nheterogeneity of species ranges within each grid.\n\n### *Estimating Functional Richness*\n\nWe investigated the spatial variation in the relative distribution of\nspecies counts of producers and consumers across all guilds in a grid\ncell, as an interaction network-level indicator of the spatial\ndistribution of producer and consumer species’ functional richness. We\nestimated functional richness (FR) from the results of the SBM model\nfit, specifically, from the matrices representing the interaction\nguilds. Thus, to measure functional richness for each taxon, we\ncalculated a vector representing the number of species across all\ninteraction guilds within each grid. To account for the differences in\nthe total number of palm and mammal species across grids, we normalized\nthis vector to the sum of palm or mammal species counts within each grid\ncell across all interaction guilds.\n\n### *Estimating Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA)*\n\nWe quantified functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) as the absolute\ndifference between the functional richness vectors across trophic\nlevels. Since each palm and mammal species in every grid cell had the\npotential to be affiliated with any of the seven interaction guilds and\nto interact with any species from the opposite trophic level both within\nand between guilds, we derived one FTA measures for each grid cell, and\nfor each pairwise palm-mammal guild combination\n\n### *Estimating Network Specialization (H2’)*\n\nWe measured network specialization at each grid cell using the metric\nH2’. H2’ is a network-level index that describes the degree of\nspecialization of interactions between species and varies between 0 and\n1 (Blüthgen et al. 2007). High values indicate networks that are more\nspecialized, meaning that specialist species from one trophic level\ninteract with specialist species from the opposite trophic level. Low\nH2’ values indicate networks among generalists, meaning that there is a\nlow specificity of interactions between species across trophic levels.\nBecause inferred networks varied in their network size (i.e., number of\nunique interactions between palms and mammals), we rarefied the\ncomputation of H2’to networks of the same absolute size per grid cell,\nresampling networks to the same number of pairwise interactions (100) at\neach grid-cell 999 times (Terry and Lewis 2020). We selected the median\nof this H2’ distribution as our grid cell level measure of network\nspecialization.\n\n### *Assessing the influence of climate on FTA*\n\nTo assess whether climate has an influence on FTA, we fitted a\nGeneralized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the relationships between\nFTA and four continuous bioclimatic predictors: Mean annual temperature\n(Temp), Precipitation seasonality (PS), Temperature seasonality (TS),\nand Total annual precipitation (Prec). Temperature gradients are\nprimarily influenced by elevation, whereas precipitation patterns\nregulate both seasonal and yearly water availability. Collectively,\nthese factors constitute the climatic drivers that shape the continent\nmultitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. The GAM approach\nallows for modelling flexible non-linear relationships between the\npredictors and the response variable using smoothed functions. We fitted\nseparate splines for each of the bioclimatic predictors. In addition, to\nassess whether the strength of interaction between producer and consumer\nguilds mediate the strength of the relationship between FTA and climate,\nwe included interaction strength as an interaction term in the GAM,\nallowing splines between FTA and climate to vary non-linearly depending\non interaction strength. We assessed model fit across two data subsets:\nthe first included all guilds, while the second excluded forbidden\ninteractions, defined as pairwise interactions between species with\ninteraction probabilities below 0.01.\n\n### *Assessing the relationship between FTA and H2’*\n\nWe used Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to investigate the relationship\nbetween rarefied grid cell network level specialization (H2’) as a\nresponse variable and FTA (z-scores) as the main predictor. We also\nadded the effect of Mean annual temperature, Total annual precipitation,\nPrecipitation seasonality, and Temperature seasonality as covariate\nfunctions because these climate variables may influence H2’\nindependently of FTA, allowing us to isolate the specific impact of FTA\non H2’ while controlling for the indirect effects of climate on FTA.\nHere, we calculated a scalar measure of functional trophic asymmetry\n(FTA') for each grid cell by summing the FTA values across all\ninteraction guilds, weighted by their respective interaction strengths.\nThis approach was selected as it appropriately accounts for the uneven\ncontributions of each guild to network structure, highlighting whether\nchanges in network specialization are primarily driven by shifts in FTA\nwithin the more specialized interaction guilds.\n\n# Results\n\n## **Interaction guild delineation**\n\nThe theta matrix derived from the SBM (Stochastic Block Model) analysis\n(Figure 2) displays an asymmetrical pattern of association among\nconsumer and producer guilds, with stronger degree of interactions\nwithin guild pairs relative to the strength of interactions between\nguild pairs. Notably, palm guild 5 is strongly associated with frugivore\nguilds 4, 5, and 6, while palm guild 3 is closely linked with frugivore\nguilds 2 and 3. Conversely, palm guilds 1 and 7 show weak or minimal\ninteractions with most frugivore guilds, whereas palm guild 5 engages\nmore broadly across multiple frugivore guilds.\n\nFor palms, growth form emerged as the primary factor influencing guild\nassociations (Figure S1). Erect palms were exclusively present in guilds\n2, 3, and 5. The guild structure also reflected variation in palm fruit\nsizes, with smaller-fruited palms found in guilds 2 and 3 (Figure S6).\nAmong mammals, activity patterns significantly determined guild\naffiliations (Figure S5): diurnal mammals were prevalent in guilds 1 and\n4, while nocturnal species dominated guilds 3, 6, and 7. Additionally,\nmammals with the highest proportion of fruit in their diets were\nconcentrated in guild 1. Large-bodied mammals were associated with\nguilds 5 and 6, whereas smaller-bodied mammals were present in guild 3,\nwith medium-sized mammals distributed across the remaining guilds\n(Figure S7).\n\n::: column-margin\n![**Figure 2:** Heatmap depicting the probability of interaction between\npalm and mammal interaction guilds defined as blocks by the Stochastic\nBlock Model (SBM).

Similarly, mammals display mixed\nresponses to environmental factors, with mean annual temperature showing\na strong effect (*F* = 10.60, *P* = 0.00), while precipitation (F =\n0.00, P = 1.00), temperature seasonality (*F* = 0.52, *P* = 0.60), and\nprecipitation seasonality (*F* = 1.67, *P* = 0.10) show no significant\neffect at the assemblage level.\n\nWhen incorporating guild into our analyses, generalized additive models\n(GAMs) reveal marked differences between trophic levels, particularly in\npalms' responses to precipitation seasonality and mammals' responses to\nmean annual temperature (Figure S10). For palms, precipitation\nseasonality (PS) exhibits significant effects within guilds 5 and 6 (*F*\n= 5.62, *P* = 0.00 and *F* = 8.37, *P* = 0.01, respectively), suggesting\nthat these guilds are especially sensitive to seasonal precipitation\nvariations (Figure S8). In contrast, mammals show no significant\nguild-specific response to precipitation seasonality; instead, their\nmost pronounced response is to temperature, specifically among species\nwithin guild 4 (F = 11.21, *P* = 0.00) (Figure S9). Notably, guild 3 for\nmammals and guilds 5 and 6 for palms represent the dominant guilds\nacross the climatic gradient.\n\n::: column-margin\n![**Figure 3:** Functional richness of mammals and palms in relation to\nenvironmental gradients of mean annual temperature and precipitation\nseasonality, categorized by interaction guilds (X1 to X7).

Our analysis revealed a bi-modal distribution of FTA:\nguilds with either high interaction strength (\\> 0.3) or no interaction\nstrength ( \\< 0.01) exhibited high FTA values, whereas guilds with\nmoderate interaction strength (0.01 - 0.3) showed low FTA values.\n\nWhen incorporating all interaction guilds, the Generalized Additive\nModeling (GAM) analysis reveals a significant effect of mean annual\ntemperature on functional trophic asymmetry (FTA), with warmer regions\nshowing elevated FTA values (*F* = 5.97, *P* = 0.01). In this model,\nother climate variables, total precipitation, precipitation seasonality,\nand temperature seasonality—do not significantly influence FTA. However,\nwhen examining the same GAM model, but excluding forbidden interactions\n(i.e. interaction strength \\< 0.01), both mean annual temperature (*F* =\n4.72, *P* = 0.03) and precipitation seasonality (*F* = 3.95*, P* \\<\n0.01) emerge as significant predictors. This refined model suggests that\nregions with high mean annual temperatures and high precipitation\nseasonality exhibit the highest FTA values. In contrast, regions with\neither warm temperatures and low precipitation seasonality or cold\ntemperatures and high precipitation seasonality are associated with\nmoderate FTA, while colder regions with low precipitation seasonality\nshow the lowest FTA values. Notably, temperature seasonality (*F* =\n0.01, *P* = 0.91) and total annual precipitation (*F* = 1.68, *P* =\n0.12) remain non-significant in this model.\n\nIn analyzing climate effects considering the variation of interaction\nstrength between consumer and producer guilds, precipitation seasonality\nshows a marginally significant effect (*F* = 0.13, *P* = 0.05). After\nfiltering out forbidden interactions, however, the influence of\ninteraction strength on the effect of precipitation seasonality becomes\nnon-significant (*F* = 0.00, *P* = 0.09), while the interaction with\ntotal annual precipitation gains statistical significance (*F* = 0.00,\n*P* = 0.04), albeit its overall effect remains low. The model that does\nnot filter by interaction strength explained a lower proportion of\ndeviance (6.56%) compared to model excluding forbidden interactions\nwhich accounted for 14.2% of the deviance in FTA (Table 1).  \n\n::: column-margin\n![**Figure 4:** Functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) and network\nspecialization (H2’) in relation to environmental gradients of mean\nannual temperature and precipitation seasonality.

Mean annual temperature\nalso exerts a significant effect (*F* = 2.12, *P* = 0.03), as does\nprecipitation seasonality PS (*F* = 2.29, *P* = 0.02) Thus, the model\nsuggests higher specialization in warm and hot regions with high\nprecipitation seasonality and even higher in grid cells where\nmultitrophic communities exhibit high functional trophic asymmetry\nacross all interaction guilds (Figure 4). In contrast, H2’ drops sharply\nfor cold and dry regions, and variation in H2’ does not relate to\nvariation in temperature seasonality or total annual precipitation (\nboth *P* \\> 0.05). The deviance explained by this model was 17.6%.\n (Table 2)\n\n::: column-margin\n![**Figure 5:** Spatial distribution of environmental and ecological\nvariables across the Neotropics.
